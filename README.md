# Analyzing LiDAR data with R and the LidR package

This is a small small sample of the work I did analyzing LiDAR data with R and the [LidR](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR) package. 

IÂ just published here the code without the original data used in the analysis because I don't use the rights of the data.
